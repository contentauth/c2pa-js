This library aims to make viewing and verifying C2PA metadata in the browser as easy as possible.

For more information, please view the documentation at https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org/docs/js-sdk/getting-started/overview.

## Prerequisites

To build this library on macOS, you must first install LLVM Clang as follows:
1. If you haven't already, install Homebrew:
  ```
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  ```
1. Install LLVM Clang:
  ```
  brew install llvm
  ```
1. Add it to your PATH:
  ```
  export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH"
  ```
  For future use, add it to your `.zshrc` file:
  ```
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
  ```

Verify the installation:
  ```
  llvm-config --version
  ```
You should see a version number, such as 20.1.3.
